# AngryScan Documentation Hub

Welcome to the aggregated documentation site for the AngryScan ecosystem. This site is
automatically built from the documentation that lives in two source repositories:

- [`angrydata-app`](https://github.com/angryscan/angrydata-app)
- [`angrydata-core`](https://github.com/angryscan/angrydata-core)

On every update, the latest documentation from those projects is synced into this site so
you always have a single reference for the entire platform. Use the navigation sidebar to
jump directly into the detailed guides for each project.

> **Tip:** If you are building the site locally, run `python scripts/sync_docs.py` first to
> pull in the latest documentation from the upstream repositories.
