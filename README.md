# AngryScan GitHub Pages

This repository powers the public documentation site for the AngryScan project. The site
is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and aggregates documentation from two
companion repositories:

- [`angrydata-app`](https://github.com/angryscan/angrydata-app)
- [`angrydata-core`](https://github.com/angryscan/angrydata-core)

The aggregation happens automatically in CI and whenever you run the helper script locally.

## Local development

1. Clone this repository alongside the other documentation sources:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/angryscan/angryscan.org.git
   git clone https://github.com/angryscan/angrydata-app.git sources/angrydata-app
   git clone https://github.com/angryscan/angrydata-core.git sources/angrydata-core
   ```

2. Install the documentation dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Sync the external documentation and start the local development server:

   ```bash
   python scripts/sync_docs.py
   python scripts/translate_docs.py
   mkdocs serve
   ```

The documentation from each project is copied verbatim into the built site. No pages authored in this
repository are publishedâ€”when the site loads, visitors are automatically redirected into the AngryData
App documentation (as the default entry point), and the navigation exposes each upstream project.
Language switching happens through the Material UI selector (Russian and Spanish are generated from the
English originals); the translated markdown files themselves are hidden from the navigation.

## Continuous deployment

GitHub Actions builds and deploys the site to GitHub Pages on every push to the default
branch. The workflow fetches the latest documentation from the two upstream repositories,
runs `scripts/sync_docs.py` followed by `scripts/translate_docs.py`, builds the MkDocs site,
and publishes the resulting static files.
